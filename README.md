VirtualBrowserComputer
This project was created to allow individuals learning JavaScript and TypeScript to work together as a team on a single application from the very beginning of their learning journey.

This requires understanding the basics of Git, which in turn provides additional experience and is a key skill for future developers.

🚀 Quick Start (Running Locally)
To run the application in your local environment, ensure you have Node.js installed and follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js installed on your system. It includes the npm package manager.

Running the Application
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/jkuznik/VirtualBrowserComputer.git
cd VirtualBrowserComputer
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Run the development server:

Bash

npx run dev
This command compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript, starts the local development server, and typically opens the application in your web browser (e.g., at http://localhost:5173).

In-app programs
The best way to learn is through practice. This project allows you to make your own changes that will noticeably impact the entire project, and these changes will be readily available when you run the application. This refers to simple CLI-style programs or games of your own design that can be integrated into the project and later accessed from the main application's user interface, "Computer." Here are the basic details you need to know.
