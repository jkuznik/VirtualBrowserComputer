# VirtualBrowserComputer
This project was created to allow individuals learning JavaScript and TypeScript to work together as a team on a single application from the very beginning of their learning journey.

This requires understanding the basics of Git, which in turn provides additional experience and is a key skill for future developers.

# 🚀 Quick Start (Running Locally)

## Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js installed on your system. It includes the npm package manager.

## Running the Application
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/jkuznik/VirtualBrowserComputer.git
cd VirtualBrowserComputer
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Run the development server:

Bash

npx run dev
This command compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript, starts the local development server, and typically opens the application in your web browser (e.g., at http://localhost:5173).
